# ChOLE Web App

The goal of the ChOLE webapp is to offer users a simple to use and device independent (PC, mac OS, iOS, Android) application to calculate the ChOLE stage. 

The user needs to choose one option for each category (Ch, O, L, E) and the application calculates the overall stage. The categories are:

Ch => Cholesteatoma Extension
O => Ossicular chain status
L => Life threatening complications
E => Eustachian tube ventilation and mastoid pneumatisation

The calculation of the overall ChOLE stage is a piece of cake. A number between 0-4 per category is summed up and then grouped by certain thresholds. 
The app is a plain frontend application, without a database in the backend.
